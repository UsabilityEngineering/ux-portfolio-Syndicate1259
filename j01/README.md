# Analysis of User Experience of E&J Gallo career website
## By Jose Sanchez 10/14/2022

[//]: # (A narrative that describes your user experience with technology. It should include your goals, a description of the interaction, and the outcome.)  
[//]: # (You should assess the user experience in terms of concepts taught in class and/or the most relevant UX goals: effective, efficient, safe, satisfying, learnable, memorable, useful, error tolerant.) 

After visiting the job fair and talking to the recruiters for E&J Gallo, they suggested I apply to their website so they can match my resume to my application on their website. After accessing their career website, I was greeted with a nice looking home page with a search bar in the middle. The search fields are "Keyword" and "Location" which are standard for a career website(Consistency and Standards Heuristic). Since I want to see all available "IT" positions, I'm going to just type "IT" for my keyword and click search.


 




To evaluate the website, I used Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. My goal for the website was to apply for an IT or Information Technology position. 

When any of the terms are used in your narrative, you should highlight them in bold and provide a description in your own words. Each journal entry should have at least one unique term that is described (not already in a previous journal entry). 
The assessment of the interaction can be nuanced, acknowledging any strengths and weaknesses. Suggestions for how the weaknesses can be addressed will make for a particularly strong journal entry.

The writing style should resemble a relatively informal style of blogs. 

The entries should also communicate to a broad audience, who do not necessarily know UX terminology, so make sure to describe things in a way most people can understand.
